        <div id="post"><p>I had jury duty the other day.  What that translates to is I had a whole day of <a href="https://twitter.com/Joe_Wegner/status/288812290910859265">forced free time</a>.  I had decided it would be a good idea to treat this time as a hackathon, and was inspired by a <a href="http://odem.chromeexperiments.com/8mEis2">Google+ demo</a> that allowed you to browse using gestures from your mobile phone.  The actual Google+ demo was pretty unexciting - it was very choppy, and not really an increase in usability at all.  But, cool nonetheless.</p>

<p><a href="John%204:43">In all reality</a>, using your mobile device as a controller for your desktop computer doesn&#39;t really have a place on the normal web - adding a new layer of abstraction isn&#39;t ever going to make things easier.  However, it does have an application in one place - gaming.  It&#39;s never been a secret that people prefer to control games with a controller rather than a mouse and keyboard.</p>

<p><code>passage=1 Timothy 1:10-3:5</code></p>

<p>So that&#39;s what I set out to do.  The end goal here is to create a library that people can use in the future, but for my forced hackathon I just wanted to create a proof of concept.  I didn&#39;t want to deal too heavily with designing a UI, so I chose the simplest game that might use a mobile controller - the keep-the-ball-on-the-tilty-thing game.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://mobile-interactive.herokuapp.com/">the demo</a> - it&#39;ll make the rest of this post make sense.  <strong>Make sure you&#39;re phone is on wifi.  There&#39;s a lot of websockets magic, which will likely suck up your available data.</strong>  This will also probably only work on chrome, both on the desktop and on your mobile.  You can try other browsers, but I don&#39;t promise any success.</p>
